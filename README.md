# Flappy_Bird

Flappy Bird main executable along with file dependencies (no installer available)

To download, click the green "code" button and click "download zip"

move the "flappy_bird-main.zip" file to documents or wherever you want it to be stored

right click on it and then click "extract all"

a pop up windown should appear, click the "show extracted files when complete" checkbox and then click extract

once it has finished extracting, you should see a new windows explorer window

go inside the flappy_bird-main folder (it should not have ".zip" on the end)

you should see another zip folder called "unityplayercompressed.zip" (i had to compress it because it was too big to upload raw)

follow the same procedure above for unzipping the file
